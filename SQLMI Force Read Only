-- Sample trigger to force reporting users to connect to the READ ONLY replica only.  Tested in SQL MI business critical
-- Example prevents "mary" or "charlie" from connecting if the "Northwind" database is read/write. 
-- Adjust logins and database name as needed.   
-- Warning - be sure to test any logic adjustments in a test environment.   Logic errors could lock you out of your server!
